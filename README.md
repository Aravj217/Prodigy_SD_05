This project is a web scraping script developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It demonstrates how to extract useful information from websites using popular Python libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and optionally pandas for data handling. The notebook guides users through the entire scraping process — from sending HTTP requests and parsing HTML content to extracting specific data elements like titles, prices, links, or tables. The project is educational and beginner-friendly, with step-by-step explanations and output displays within the notebook format. It’s a great introduction to automation and data collection from websites for tasks such as research, analysis, or data science preparation. This is not a standalone application but a functional code-based project that runs inside Jupyter Notebook. To use it, simply open the .ipynb file, modify the target URL or scraping logic as needed, and run the cells.
